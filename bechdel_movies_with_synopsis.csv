Instead, Nick, Dale, and Kurt drunkenly and hypothetically discuss how to kill their bosses, and before they know it, they've hired a murder consultant to help them pull off the three deeds."

As they get to the final hit, Jay begins to unravel once again - his paranoia sending him deep into the heart of darkness.
Hitmen Jay and Gal haven't had a job for about 8 months, Jay is married to Shel and has a son around the age of 10 called Sam. Gal isn't married but does have a mysterious looking girlfriend, Fiona. Prior to the dinner they have together at Jay's, Shel and Jay argue frequently as Jay can't pay for things as he isn't working, or hasn't got a job as such.
During the dinner they have together Shel and Jay have another argument, shouting in the kitchen as Fiona sits awkwardly at the table, Gal goes upstairs to explain to Sam how his parents will still be together even though they are arguing at each other. A few drinks later and Shel and Jay are good again, laughing and cuddling outside with Gal whilst he sits back into his chair to relax. However during this scene Fiona is nowhere to be seen,instead she is in the house in the bathroom upstairs looking into the mirror. She then takes the mirror off and carves a cross with a triangle on it, the image first shown at the start of the film. She then picks up the tissues Jay used to wipe his cut whilst shaving in the morning and places them in her bra, hanging up the mirror and then leaving.
The dinner was so that Gal and Jay could talk about the new job they had got, they would meet up with the person who demanded their services and that would be that. The Client cuts Jay on the palm and also cuts his, signing his paper with the blood from each hand.
The first victim on the kill list is known as The Priest, easily enough the two wait for him to walk back into his office where they have covered everything, 'Turn around' Jay says pointing a gun at him, he does so and replies 'Thank you', as Jay puts a bullet through his head.
The next is The Librarian, Jay and Gal catch him walking out of a lock up and wait for him to leave before going inside to check out what The Librarian has to hide, it turns out to be a 'Wank bank' as Gal turns the computer on to his disgust, Jay then watches too, his expression one of disgust and of no mercy. The next day the two go to The Librarian's house, punching and knocking him to the floor as they enter and Gal close the door. They sit him down as he says 'There must be a case of mistaken identity', but no, Jay asks him about the videos and who films them, after a beating The Librarian gives them a location, also telling Gal where his safe is. As Gal goes to open the safe, The Librarian says to Jay 'He (referring to Gal) doesn't know who you are'. Jay looks at him confused, as he opens his toolkit and takes out a hammer and smashes The Librarians knee. In the safe Gal finds money, and then a folder, with multiple files in it, Jay then smashes the hand of The Librarian before placing his head on the table and standing in front of him with a hammer. 'Thank you, thank you' The Librarian says as Jay repeatedly slams the hammer into his head. After this Jay tells Gal they're going to the address he gave them, where Jay kills all the film crew in a gory manner.
The last name on the kill list, is an MP. Before they go to kill him Shel makes Jay an appointment for his hand as it has become infected from the cut. He meets The Doctor, who does anything but look at his hand, asks Jay about what he does day to day and if he's stressed. He then says something along the lines of 'The past is forgotten, the future is yet to come, but what we do now is a moment' to Jay. Later at home, Jay is laying on his sofa as he takes two pills, Shel then calls him, where he finds their pet cat wrapped up in string hanging in front of the front door. Gal comes round and talks to Shel, telling her that Jay needs help and that they should stop with the job. The next day Gal and Jay meet with The Client who says if they don't go through with the killings then their families will be killed, Gal asks why theses people needed to be killed to which The Client replies 'A new formation'.
Gal and Jay camp out in the woods with a view of the house, however as they get ready to watch as night falls, they are faced with a different kind of problem.
A group of men and women walk through the woods with torches, some naked and others in robes, all with masks made out of straws. One woman has a thorn crown which has been pulled down her face to cover her eyes causing them to bleed. Gal and Jay follow them to an area surrounded by torches and a noose attached to a wooden structure. A woman walks up in a beautiful dress and places the noose around her neck, she then waves before kicking the stool she stood on, as she struggles all the cult members clap. Jay then decides he that enough is enough and opens fire, all the members chase after the two who are now running through the woods trying to escape.
Gal finds an entrance to a network of tunnels which the pair take, running through the pair get split up and Gal Kills a few with his trusted shotgun, however one member catches him by surprise jumping on him and stabbing him in the stomach even though Gal then shoots him in the head. Jay finds Gal bleeding out, and carries him for a while, however Gal tells him to leave, and we see Jay walk out of the forest area the two arrived in. In the car Jay has flashbacks of the memories he had with Gal, whilst picking at the infected cut on his hand. He returns to Shel and Sam, who aren't in their previous house. As Gal looks to the window he can see flames burning. He then runs outside and shoots randomly, running back inside and giving Shel the gun. He then goes out, trying to find whoever is out there. Shel sits in a room, waiting for anyone to walk in, with a gun she shoots the first person twice and then kills another.
The camera then finds Jay, on the floor without his shirt on, someone then places a straw mask on his face as he stands up, he finds himself surrounded by the cult members in a circle. Opposite him stands another, covered in a white sheet, somewhat crippled. He is then given a knife and they fight each other. Jay's expertise comes out as he is able to slash at his opponent and repeatedly stabs them in the back once they have fallen to the floor to secure the kill.
He then stands up, removing his mask and moving to see who he has just killed, removing his opponents mask he finds his wife, bleeding and then laughing as blood flows out of her mouth, he then moves to remove the cloth and finds his son, who he had unknowingly stabbed furiously, now dead. He stands their, paralysed. The cult masters remove their masks, revealing The Doctor Jay had seen, The Client and Fiona. The Client places a crown atop Jay's head, as he stands there, victor of the battle, killer of his wife and child."

Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison.

As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him.

Rebecca is pretending to have fallen asleep so that his father won't tell her to go home for the night. When Thomas' father comes to check on her and sees that she's sleeping, her father on the phone agrees to let her spend the night there. The next morning, the children ride their bikes in the cold beach, armed with coats, scarves and hats.Grandpa has fallen asleep on a chair, and they look at his skin with a magnifying glass. When it looks like he's going to wake up, they run away. On another occasion they look at a small snail. While they stare at its slow movements, they talk about their lives away from the holiday location. Tommy kisses Rebecca on the lips. Later, she is having a bath - she is leaving in the ferry at 6:00 with her family. Tommy is left behind, a lonely child once again, while the ferry silently leaves.An adult Rebecca stares at the morsel sculpture on the pier. Rebecca has returned from Japan, where her family lived. An adult Thomas (Matt Smith) was with another girl and there is an uncomfortable silence for everybody: Thomas is amazed at her having come back. The girlfriend smokes a cig while listening to the conversation until she decides to leave for good. It's raining when Rebecca is about to leave, but you can feel that they still have feelings for each other. Thomas says that the girl was not really a girlfriend - he undresses and swims in the sea, while Rebecca giggles. He has dinner, she stares at him, they end up having sex together. They stop the car to go in a seemingly empty road, but another car arrives and can't avoid but killing Thomas in spite of trying to halt to a stop.He has written to her I'LL WAIT FOR YOU FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES in a piece of notebook page which was inside of a matchbox with the shell of the dead snail.

When he is 5 years old, Thomas (Jesse Hoffmann) uses a quilt to hide and talk with his mother. Rebecca supposedly kisses him under the quilt, - although this may be my guess.Thomas talks a poem standing naked in the bath, while her mother is also having a bath stark naked. She claps and then hugs him in what I consider an awkward and inappropriate way. Other mothers have a problem with Rebecca and Thomas' situation, and they don't want it to affect their own children. A teacher (Amanda Lawrence) agrees with the mothers. Thomas, meanwhile, was playing with his friend Eric (Adrian Wahlen). The mothers stare at cocky Rebecca while she is riding after Thomas. All this leads to Thomas' birthday party being a complete failure, because Molly (Ella Smith) and all the rest of mothers and children refused to be Thomas' friends. Thomas is upset at this, of course, and shouts to his mother. Rebecca gives him a moving toy dinosaur to be of some consolation.Finally, Thomas finds a friend of his own - a neighbour of his own age. Rebecca works from home through her computer.Another day, mother and son are playing, and he sits on top of her as though he were a love whom she were playing with. The awkward situation is solved when that new male friend appears - they play with the toy dinosuar burying in the beach while it's still moving.Years later, Thomas - the son, now looking exactly like his biological father /clone - (Matt Smith) goes out with Monica (Hannah Murray) and there's another awkward moment when Rebecca finds them on bed after having had sex. The relationship is disturbing to Rebecca, although she doesn't want to admit it, probably not even to herself. She sits by Thomas in his bed while he's sleeping. He covers him with a bedspread and lies down herself by his side. He wakes up startled after caressing her own mother, thinking it was Monica.Rebecca hides herself and watches her son and Monica about to have sex. Monica and Thomas' relationship keeps on getting stronger and stronger. The grandmother on-the-father's-side appears - Thomas has had a sea bath, naked, with Rebecca. Thomas can't even recognise her grandmother, who stares at Thomas in almost disbelief. Monica sees everything in disbelief. Rebecca runs inside whimpering. Monica, Rebecca and Thomas have a conversation during breakfast, and he leaves in anger.After a bath, and Monica having gone away, Rebecca gives his son his father's laptop. He is even more angry at her, but they both end up having sex. That night, Thomas decides to leave home for good. Rebecca tries to refrain herself from saying or doing anything.

The Comedian belongs to both groups. Despite the activities of the Watchmen leading to the west winning the Vietnam War which in turn has kept Richard Nixon in the White House, Nixon has now outlawed masks, resulting in the Watchmen disbanding and going into retirement, most hiding their Watchmen past under their human identities. However, the Comedian, in his human persona of Eddie Blake, and Dr. Manhattan - former physicist Jon Osterman who obtained his superhero powers through a scientific accident which almost killed him - now work for the government. Dr. Manhattan's powers in particular have kept a watch over nuclear proliferation, as he is able to stop any nuclear attack. Regardless, the Cold War is at its height with recent Soviet posturing regarding nuclear bomb buildup.

Evidence points to it perhaps having something to do with an imminent attempt of nuclear annihilation. Rorschach has to convince his colleagues, who he has not seen since their superhero days, of the validity of his theory for them to come out of retirement, which is no easy task. If they do, which will require them to overcome external forces which seem to be conspiring against them, they will have to discover both who killed the Comedian and why before they befall the same fate as him and/or before the mastermind is able to exact his larger grand plan."

Fresh off of a successful production of Death of a aa/2Salesman, he has traded in the suburban blue-hairs and regional theater of Schenectady for the cultured audiences and bright footlights of Broadway. Armed with a MacArthur grant and determined to create a piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can put his whole self, he gathers an ensemble cast into a warehouse in Manhattan's theater district. He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their constructed lives in a small mock-up of the city outside. As the city inside the warehouse grows, Caden's own life veers wildly off the tracks. The shadow of his ex-wife Adele, a celebrated painter who left him years ago for Germany's art scene, sneers at him from every corner. Somewhere in Berlin, his daughter Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend, Maria. He's helplessly driving his marriage to actress Claire into the ground. Sammy Barnathan, the actor Caden has hired to play himself within the play, is a bit too perfect for the part, and is making it difficult for Caden to revive his relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel. Meanwhile, his therapist, Madeline Gravis, is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counselling him. His second daughter, Ariel, is disabled. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his autonomic functions, one by one. As the years rapidly pass, Caden buries himself deeper into his masterpiece. Populating the cast and crew with doppelgangers, he steadily blurs the line between the world of the play and that of his own deteriorating reality. As he pushes the limits of his relationships, both personally and professionally, a change in creative direction arrives in Millicent Weems, a celebrated theater actress who may offer Caden the break he needs."

The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily-given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of Earth from returning by stealing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny."

John poses the question, ""What if a man, from the Upper Paleolithic survived until the present day?"" They assume that John is working on a science fiction story and play along with the discussion. As the film progresses, John slowly reveals that he is the ""caveman"" under discussion when he mentions that he was given a chance to sail with Christopher Columbus in the 15th century. The revelation starts off with John's recollection of the terrain of prehistoric Earth and John's origins, which happens to be roughly 14,000 years ago. John reveals that he was once Jacques Borne, a friend of Van Gogh's, and he is now ""moving on"" since some people have noticed his lack of aging.As they take a break from the discussion, Art who is concerned about John's sanity telephones another friend, Dr. Will Gruber (Richard Riehle), an elderly psychologist, explaining the odd situation and asks him to come over right away. In the meantime, Sandy confesses to John that she loves him, but John tells her they can never be together because of his immortality. John resumes his story by stating that he was once a Sumerian for 2000 years, then a Babylonian under Hammurabi, and finally a disciple of Gautama Buddha. Dr. Gruber arrives, at which point Dan mentions that John's tale is as impossible to be disproved as it is to be verified, a response to the many attempts to poke holes in John's story by his colleagues. The discussion takes a turn into the biological and physical condition of John and the topic of death. Gruber propels the discussion deeper into the topic of death and tension rises as Gruber interrogates John on that subject. The tension culminates with Gruber pointing a gun at John. After the drama ends with the departure of Gruber, Harry reveals that Gruber's wife has passed away the day before and the profession of John's immortality had hit Gruber very hard. Art and Edith are upset with John's story, while Harry, Dan, Sandy, and Linda appear to be more sympathetic.John also mentions that he is not a follower of a particular religion, and he doesn't believe in an omnipotent God. John's audience is shocked when he reveals how he survived the crucifixion when he was Jesus by ""blocking the pain"", a technique he learned in India. He explains the origin of the Resurrection, Moses, and other events and people in the Bible. Tempers and emotions rise as Edith pressures John to recant his story, which offends her deep-rooted faith in the Bible. Dr. Gruber returns to the scene and apologizes to John for his ""infantile behavior"". As John continues to pack his belongings onto the truck, his colleagues begin to talk about the possibility of John being mentally ill or high on drugs.The discussions of John being Jesus, Christianity, and the Bible continue and Edith, unable to take John's tale anymore, breaks down crying. Emotions in the room run high. Gruber takes charge of the situation and sternly demands that John end his ""high tale"" and give closure to the story; he threatens John with the possibility of locking him up for observation. John apologizes to everyone and, as he doesn't want to further upset any of his friends, he tells them that all he just told them is just a story.As each of John's friends leave, John apologizes to Harry and Edith, while Art and Linda leave without many parting words. When it is Dan's turn to say goodbye, it is hinted that Dan believes John's story. After everyone but Dr. Gruber and Sandy has left, Dr. Gruber overhears John relating to Sandy some of the other pseudonyms he has used over the years. One used over 60 years ago was the name of Gruber's father, a chemistry professor from Harvard, who had left the family. Gruber, shocked and over-excited, suffers a heart attack and dies. After Gruber's body is taken away, the movie ends with Sandy walking towards John (sitting in his truck); at the last minute he changes his mind to spend some part of his life with her."

Although initially reluctant to do it because of the difficulty, Theo is able to grant Julian this favor, however with the change that he now needs to accompany Kee on her journey. As Theo and Kee progress on that journey, Theo learns more and more about what's going on, including the reason that Kee needs to get to the coast, the fact that no one in the group knows if their end destination even exists, and that his and Kee's lives are in greater danger than he believed when they started the journey. But Theo's sole mission becomes to help Kee at any cost for the survival of the species."

A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable, and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill (Dylan Baker), mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), and adolescent son Timmy (Kesun Loder) - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic, since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido (Sir Billy Connolly), as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path."

He comes to realize someone is swimming in the pool after 7 p.m., which is not allowed. The pool cleaner also brings to his attention that there seem to be globs of some sort of hair in the pools filter that have accumulated in just one day. One night, when he is very tired, he hears splashing in the pool and thinks that at last he will catch the mystery swimmer. But when he goes to the pool, there is no one there, not even footprints. As he walks around the pool, he hears someone splashing in the water at that very moment. He thinks all he has to do is wait, and they will surface soon enough. He picks up a brush and walks around the pool, takes a bad step, falls, hits his head and rolls into the pool.In the next scene we find Heep laying on his own couch, and a nude young woman is sitting across from him. There is water on the floor. He asks if she brought him here, but she only nods that she did. He gives her a shirt to wear. She clings to him, saying that she is too scared to go outside. So there he sits, with a young woman in his lap clinging to him who then falls asleep. He is clearly uncomfortable and tries to wake her. He decides he should take her outside for some fresh air, and then he will walk her home. Once outside, however, he is confronted with a growling creature which sends them both screaming back into his house.Heep needs to know who she is and what the creature is. We learn that her name is Story and that there is a creature hunting her. She is somehow prohibited from telling him who she is or what is happening, but she does tell him that she is a Narf. Heep begins asking his tenants if they have ever heard of a character called a Narf. Upon asking a young Asian student named Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung), she says she has heard of a Narf as part of a bedtime story that was told long ago to her mother, but she doesn't remember much about the story. Heep continues doing his repairs, and we are introduced to many of the tenants. Between tasks, Heep tries to catch Young-Soon when she is with her grandmother, so he can ask more questions about the story. Though she has no idea why he is asking all these questions, she is happy to do what she can for this oddly curious man. Her grandmother, however, is suspicious as to why a grown man is so interested in a bedtime story.Frustrated at only getting bits and pieces of the story here and there, he arranges to be invited into the apartment of Young-Soon and her grandmother. Young-Soon tells him to try and act more like a curious child than a man, and it will help to bring out the grandmother's softer side so she will tell him more about the story of Story. After wiggling, eating cookies and dribbling milk down his face, the grandmother is amused and tells him the story.Meanwhile, Story is walking through his apartment, marveling at various objects. She notices a different-looking book and takes it down and reads it. The book is actually a journal, one that Heep wrote following the tragic loss of his family. When Heep discovers her reading the book, he asks her not to tell anyone of his past; no one there knows the story or that he used to be a doctor. He also needs to check with Story that what he has learned so far is accurate. Though Story cannot actually say, she makes a sign when he makes a correct statement.It seems Story is a Narf, here to motivate a great writer to complete his work that will have a tremendous positive effect on the future, at which point a giant eagle will come and take her home. But there is a creature called a Scrunt who will try to kill her before she can complete her task. There are many people who live in the apartment comple, besides the writer, who will unknowingly play different parts in helping Story. Heep believes himself to be her ""guardian"", the one who can protect her from the Scrunt. In a scene that starts out suspenseful but becomes rather light, Heep tries to face down and battle the Scrunt, being coached by Story via walkie talkie, but it soon becomes apparent that he is not the guardian when the Scrunt attacks him. The attack is interrupted by an arrogant movie critic just in the nick of time.But now Heep has an idea of what he needs to help Story get home. He must cast the roles needed to complete the task from the diverse people that live in the apartment complex. It is such a complex undertaking that he decides to consult the latest addition to the complex, the arrogant movie critic, to help him root out some of the characters described to him. Heep finally concocts a plan, but it is misguided. When it fails, the Scrunt seizes hold of Story and tries to drag her away, but Heep manages to grab hold of her. It is now apparent they have the wrong people for the roles, and they need to rethink them fast.The pivotal character to find is the ""symbolist"", who can ""read"" the situation, giving a much better description of the characters needed and what they all must do.

King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor.

Barrie (James)'s latest effort has garnered less than positive reviews, something he knew would be the case even before the play's mounting. This failure places pressure on James to write another play quickly as impresario Charles Frohman needs another to replace the failure to keep his theater viable. Out for a walk with his dog in part to let his creative juices flow, James stumbles upon the Llewelyn Davies family: recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (the daughter of now deceased author George L. Du Maurier) and her four adolescent sons. James and the family members become friends, largely based on he and the boys being able to foster in each other the imagination of children, James just being the biggest among them in this regard. Sylvia also welcomes James into their lives, he who becomes an important and integral part of it. Among the six of them, the only one who does not want to partake is Sylvia's third, Peter Llewelyn Davies, who is still grieving the reality of their lives, where his father was there one day planning an outing for the family, and gone the next. Two other people who don't appreciate James in the Llewelyn Davies' lives are: his wife, Mary Barrie, who always feels the need to be the responsible one in their relationship and who feels threatened by his friendship with an unmarried woman; and Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's overbearing mother, who sees him as an obstacle to Sylvia moving on with her life with another potential husband, and an impediment to maintaining discipline within the boys. James still hopes to bring Peter out of his self-imposed shell, but in the process comes up with an idea for another play based on an amalgam of himself and Peter, that play which eventually becomes what Charles sees as a largely unmountable and thus doomed production called ""Peter Pan"". This process of helping Peter could take a step backward when it looks like Sylvia may imminently befall a similar fate to that of her late husband."

The book details the story of rare orchid hunter John Laroche, whose passion for orchids and horticulture made Orlean discover passion and beauty for the first time in her life. Charlie wants to be faithful to the book in his adaptation, but despite Laroche himself being an interesting character in his own right, Charlie is having difficulty finding enough material in Laroche to fill a movie, while equally not having enough to say cinematically about the beauty of orchids. At the same time, Charlie is going through other issues in his life. His insecurity as a person doesn't allow him to act upon his feelings for Amelia Kavan, who is interested in him as a man. And Charlie's twin brother, pretentious Donald, has moved into his house with a goal of also becoming a screenwriter. Despite not admiring Donald as a screenwriter, Charlie asks for his advice. Together, they feel that there is some interesting subtext in the book on which Orlean herself can only elaborate, if only Charlie has the nerve to talk to her. If she can't or won't elaborate, they may have to find out the meaning of that subtext on their own."

He enjoys his freedom, as when he races with an eagle, but he also remembers his responsibilities, as when he saves two foals from being attacked by a cougar. One night he sees a campfire in the distance and goes to investigate, despite his mother wanting him to stay. When he reaches the camp, horses tied nearby encourage him to leave, but he wants to know who's there. His nosing causes the men to wake up and chase him, eventually catching him as his mother and herd watch from a nearby cliff. His mother tries to go to him, but he urges her and the herd to flee, which they do.Spirit is taken to an army fort, where he defies all their efforts to brand, shoe, and break him. He and a Colonel (James Cromwell) have taken an instant dislike to each other, so the Colonel orders Spirit to be tied to a post for three days with no food or water. While he is tied, a young Lakota brave named Little Creek (Daniel Studi) is brought in and tied to another post.That night, his friends throw him a dagger, which he conceals from the soldiers as they file out at dawn on the third day. The Colonel himself attempts to ride Spirit, who, despite his best efforts, cannot throw him and appears to give up, exhausted. The Colonel is very pleased with himself and rides Spirit around the corral, boasting. But Spirit is merely regaining his strength and, in a final show of defiance, grabs the reins, breaks the saddle, and tosses the Colonel off his back. The Colonel is furious and attempts to shoot Spirit, but Little Creek cuts himself free and shoves the gun away.The two then escape, taking all the other horses with them in the process. Once free, Little Creek calls his own horse, a beautiful paint mare named Rain, and jumps onto her. Spirit is momentarily distracted and is caught again, this time by the Lakota.At the Lakota's camp, Spirit is puzzled by Rain and Little Creek's relationship, wondering why a horse would ever accept a human. After a failed attempt to ride Spirit, Little Creek ties Spirit and Rain together and lets them loose. Spirit thinks he's free and starts to run off, but Rain stands firm. He relents and lets her show him around her world, falling for her in the process, but still longing to be free. He starts to respect Little Creek too, although he still won't let him on his back.Little Creek finally realizes that no one should ever ride Spirit and sets him free, knowing that the wild is where he belongs. Spirit is ecstatic and immediately finds Rain, wanting her to come with him. But even though she loves him, she feels a kinship with Little Creek and wants to stay with him. While they are together, the Colonel and his men attack the Lakota camp and Rain leaves to help Little Creek, with Spirit hot on her heels trying to stop her. After losing sight of her for a moment he finally spots her, with Little Creek on her back, running toward the Colonel, who levels a gun at them. Rain rears and is shot, with both her and Little Creek falling into a raging river.Little Creek clings to a rock and is almost shot as well, but Spirit rams the Colonel's horse, saving him, and the two share a brief look before Spirit runs off to save Rain, who has been swept away by the current. Although he reaches her, he cannot swim against the rapids and the two are swept over a waterfall. Spirit survives and finds Rain lying on a bank, barely alive. He stays with her all night and is captured by the army again in the morning. They leave Rain, believing that she's not going to make it, and she is found by Little Creek. Little Creek is amazed that Spirit saved his life and pursues the train he is loaded on. Spirit is despondent and on the verge of giving up when the swirling snow outside the car reminds him of his herd and he realizes that he can't give up and must get back to them.Spirit and other horses are used by the railroad to move a steam engine up a steep mountain. Coming over the top, Spirit realizes that the railroad tracks are headed directly towards his homeland and that he must escape and stop them. Thinking quickly, he pretends to faint and, once he is released from his harness, frees the other horses. The engine tumbles down the mountain and smashes the railroad's base, with Spirit barely managing to outrun it. He thinks everything is all right until he realizes that the explosion started a forest fire. He runs but finds a large log in his path. He clears it, but a chain that was still around his neck catches on a branch and he is helpless until Little Creek appears and cuts him loose.The two escape the fire by jumping off a cliff into a river. The next morning, they have a joyful reunion which is cut short by the Colonel and his men finding them. Little Creek urges Spirit to run but he doubles back and pushes Little Creek onto his back, much to his surprise. Spirit runs into a canyon, and they manage to evade their pursuers, only to find themselves on a high plateau, the only way out being across a deep gorge. Spirit harnesses all his strength and makes a spectacular leap, flying across the chasm to safety. The soldiers arrive on the plateau and one of them attempts to shoot Spirit, but the Colonel grabs the gun. He and Spirit exchange nods of respect before the soldiers leave.The two friends celebrate, and Spirit allows Little Creek to ride him back to the Lakota camp. Upon arriving, Spirit is saddened because he does not see Rain, but Little Creek whistles and she appears, perfectly well. Little Creek says goodbye to Rain, realizing her place is with Spirit. He asks Spirit to take care of her, addressing him as ""Spirit-who-could-not-be-broken"". Although he has waited for this moment for a long time, Spirit finds the goodbye harder than he thought. He and Rain travel to his homeland and find his herd, and his mother, safe and sound.They gallop off, with Spirit and Rain in the lead, as the camera pans up to reveal horse-like clouds running across the sky."

He is forty-something Seymour, who would admit that he beats to his own drummer and too cannot tolerate being with people who he just doesn't understand.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time."

Typical wallflower Jane also hates both her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents.

Both Janie and Angela can see Lester's sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive 18-year-old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective.

Believing Ray's soul to be inhabiting the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches Chucky back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll a decade ago. Though her chants initially fail to produce results, Chucky unexpectedly springs to life and smothers Tiffany's goth admirer, Damien (Alexis Arquette), as Tiffany looks on with excitement. Chucky, who is still intent on becoming human again, lays out a plan to retrieve the body-switching amulet Ray was wearing on the night he was killed. The amulet was buried along with his body in a cemetery in Hackensack, New Jersey.Hoping to pick up where she and Ray left off, Tiffany presents Chucky with a diamond ring which he left for her. Upon realizing that Tiffany believed the gift to be an engagement ring, Chucky bursts out laughing, explaining that he stole it from one of his wealthier victims when he was a notorious human serial killer. Heartbroken and enraged, Tiffany punishes Chucky by locking him in a playpen. That next morning, Tiffany approaches a young neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabile) with an offer to ferry Chucky's body across state lines in exchange for money. Eager to elope with his girlfriend, Jade (Katherine Heigl), and having been foiled in the past by her possessive uncle, Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), Jesse accepts the offer.Inside Tiffany's mobile home, Chucky tries to woo her into freeing him. As a mocking gesture, Tiffany responds by lowering a female children's doll, clad in a miniature wedding dress, into Chucky's playpen. Now irate, Chucky breaks free and surprises Tiffany while she is bathing, dropping a television set into her bathtub and electrocuting her to death. Still dragging the bridal doll, Chucky then recites the familiar voodoo chant, transferring Tiffany's soul into the doll. Chucky blackmails her by pointing out her only hope for becoming human again is to help him steal the amulet. After Tiffany makes a series of vivid alterations to her doll body, the killers pretend to be inanimate as Jesse arrives to pick up the dolls. He then goes to rendezvous with Jade, unaware that the dolls plan on appropriating their bodies once they have the amulet.Midway into the trip, Jade's uncle tracks down the van and starts to inspect it while the couple is away. Annoyed by Kincaid's interference, the killers rig a trap which embeds several nails into the Chief's face, then hide his body inside an onboard trunk. Later, Jesse and Jade stop for supplies and attract the notice of a police officer, who detects the scent of marijuana (which Chucky is smoking). Chucky mistakenly throws the narcotics into view, giving the officer enough cause to detain Jesse. Chucky sneaks over to the officer's squad car, stuffs a wadded-up shirt into the gas tank, and lights it on fire, killing the officer in an explosion.Shaken by the prospect that one of them might be a murderer, Jesse and Jade nevertheless stop at a couples-only hotel to get married. During the ceremony, Chief Kincaid awakens and rises out from the trunk in which Chucky and Tiffany had hidden him. Before he can crawl away, Chucky stabs him repeatedly in the back and re-deposits his body inside the trunk. Meanwhile, Jesse and Jade make the acquaintance of a pair of swingers who pickpocket their money. Tiffany follows the thieves to their private room and tosses a bottle of champagne at the mirrored ceiling above their bed, fatally impaling the couple with shards of glass. Chucky is aroused by this spectacle, and dolls have sex in the blood-soaked room.After a maid discovers the corpse that next morning, Jesse and Jade are both convinced that the other is a killer. Following another escape, they are surprised to run into their mutual friend and confidante, David (Gordon Michael Woolvett), who informs them that they are wanted for multiple murders. Whilst driving, David convinces both to stop accusing each other and patch things up. Upon realizing their misunderstanding, Jesse and Jade resolve their differences. However, David smells a foul odor and uncovers Jade's dead uncle inside the trunk. Concealing his horror, David carefully takes the Chief's gun and order Jesse to pull over, prompting Chucky to reveal himself to everyone. Startled by what he has seen, David unknowingly backs into the path of an oncoming semi truck and is fatally struck before figuring out Jade and Jesse are innocent. A radio announcement informs Chucky the fingerprints found at the scene have been identified as those of Charles Lee Ray, and that authorities plan to exhume his body as part of the investigation.With the van now under suspicion, the dolls transfer their quarry into a stolen recreational vehicle. Jesse is forced to be their driver while Tiffany gives Jade a makeover, getting her ready for when they transfer bodies. As the group nears the Hackensack cemetery, Jesse quips to Chucky that Tiffany ""isn't much of a homemaker"", due to the fact that there are several dishes in the sink. In response, Chucky orders Tiffany to clean up a little. Jade, taking her lead from Jesse, confides to Tiffany, ""You were nice enough to cook for him. The least he could do is wash a dish"", igniting a loud, volatile argument between the dolls. In the confusion, Jesse intentionally swerves off the road and crashes, while Tiffany is knocked into the oven by Jade. Still tied to a chair, Jade lays trapped and sees that Tiffany is still alive, though badly charred. Jesse cuts Jade free and pulls her out of the RV before sparking wiring causes the vehicle to explode. Jesse is blown clear, but Jade is taken hostage by Chucky.Chucky approaches his open grave site, shoots the gravedigger exhuming his body in the back of the head, and sends Jade in to open his coffin at gunpoint. She reluctantly retrieves the amulet and throws it to him, but Jesse reappears, dragging Tiffany by her hair. Chucky agrees to let Jade go in exchange for Tiffany. When the couples reunite, Chucky ties the teenagers together and starts to perform the ritual. Touched by Jesse and Jade's love for each other, and seeing Chucky's disgust at her disfigurement, Tiffany betrays Chucky by stabbing him in the back, quoting from Bride of Frankenstein: ""Oh, Chucky, look at us. Don't you see? We belong dead.""Tiffany releases the teenagers from their bonds, but Chucky retaliates by attacking Tiffany with a shovel. Chucky gets the upper hand, stabbing Tiffany in the chest; however, Jesse retrieves the shovel and knocks Chucky into his own grave, trapping him in the 6-foot pit. As Chucky screams and curses, a police Lieutenant (Lawrence Dane) who has been pursuing the suspicious teens arrives and witnesses the living doll. Jade takes the detective's gun and aims at Chucky, who promises to one day return just like in every sequel of the film series; ""But dying is such a bitch."" Chucky is shot to death, his lifeless body collapsing next to his former human shell.In the aftermath of what he has just witnessed, the Lieutenant radios in to report Jade and Jesse are innocent, and allows them to run away together. Before the rest of police unit can arrive, the Lieutenant discovers Tiffany's body. After poking her a few times, the charred doll springs to life. The Lieutenant screams in horror as a screeching, sharp-tooth baby emerges from beneath Tiffany's dress and attacks him."

They have been trying for quite some time without success but Eddie, while working at home, discovers the secret to successfully obtain energy from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. The next day in the lab, the machine is perfected by Eddie and everything appears to be working and stable. To celebrate, a party is thrown in the lab. That night after the party, project physicist Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachael Weisz) tries to leave the lab but her car battery is dead. Eddie offers to take her home as she is obviously intoxicated, so they walk off in search of a taxi. Back in the lab, Drs. Alistair Barkley and Lu Chen are on their computers while a van is seen driving towards the lab. Chen hears a noise and goes to investigate, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants as Alistair also comes under attack.Meanwhile, Lily and Eddie arrive at her house and after making sure she is okay, Eddie heads back to the lab to get his bike. As he arrives at the lab, he sees a suspicious van driving away and detects alarms coming from the lab. He runs inside to find Alistair with a plastic bag over his head (Eddie is unable to revive him) and Chen nowhere to be found. The hydrogen reactor is on and dangerously unstable so Eddie goes over to the computers to try to stabilize the reaction, but is locked out of the system. Realizing the reactor is going to blow, Eddie runs out, jumps on his bike and speeds away as a concealed detonator triggers a massive explosion that destroys the lab and surrounding streets, eight blocks total. As rescue crews arrive, Eddie is questioned by the police and later the FBI about what happened the night of the blast. Upon returning with Lily to their homes, they soon come to suspect that they are being framed as fake evidence is planted in both of their houses.Both go on the run and head to an observatory belonging to Maggie McDermott, an old friend of Eddie's. After resting up they contact Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman), the man funding the project (along with DARPA), but are almost caught in the process and barely manage to escape. As Eddie and Lily are evading more police, Paul meets with Lyman Earl Collier (Cox) at C-Systems Research complex to discuss the current events. It becomes apparent that the plot to destroy the lab and frame Eddie and Lily for it was orchestrated by this company, and that Lyman is the one who ordered the attack on the lab. Despite some disagreement, Paul and Lyman decide to continue the hunt for Eddie and Lily, a task made easier when Eddie sends a coded message to Paul requesting another place to meet. At this new rendezvous, Paul reveals he was the one who framed Eddie. The meeting ends in an ambush, and Lily is captured as Eddie barely escapes.By tracing the license plate on the van used in the ambush, Eddie is able to track them to the C-Systems Research facility where Lily and Chen are being held. When C-Systems' test reactor fails again, Paul, the scientists and the prisoners all leave the room, so Eddie takes the opportunity to ""fix"" the system. The next morning, one of the other scientists discovers the working reactor and everyone celebrates. Paul is suspicious, and immediately obtains a download of the fusion data, and secretly gives it to his assistant, Anita, for safekeeping. He then finds Eddie at a computer in the company board room. There, Eddie demands to be let go in exchange for making the reactor work. Paul agrees but Lyman refuses, believing that the reactor already works, so Eddie sets the reactor to explode while sending proof of his innocence to the FBI and blueprints of the reactor to ""hopefully a couple thousand"" international scientists.Lyman responds by shooting Chen dead, then leaving both Eddie and Lily to die in the explosion as he, Paul, and their staff flee the site, setting lock-down doors on the way. As the base self-destructs and Eddie and Lily manage to (in a feat of ingenuity) make their escape from the reactor room, Lyman is given a fake copy of the fusion data. Paul then shoots Lyman for overstepping the bounds of the program, leaving his body in an elevator to be incinerated in the ensuing inferno. During his own escape, Paul deactivates the containment, letting Eddie and Lily escape. As he is doing this, Eddie and Lily struggle with security over an ascending construction lift, ending in Eddie and Lily climbing aboard it, moments before a blast wave sweeps into the tunnel. Both Eddie and Lily survive the shock-wave to be met by FBI now convinced of their innocence, who take them to safety. Paul departs the scene via chauffeured sedan. He is last seen dictating a memo to Anita. The memo informs the Director of CIA that C-System is ""...no longer a viable entity. Will be in contact."""

California housewife Carol White seems to have it all in life: a wealthy husband, a beautiful house, servants, beauty, and a lot of friends. The only thing she lacks is a strong personality: Carol seems timid and empty during all of her interactions with the world around her. At the beginning of the film, one would consider her to be more safe in life than just about anyone. That doesn't turn out to be the case. Starting with headaches and leading to a grandmal seizure, Carol becomes more and more sick, claiming that she's become sensitive to the common toxins in today's world: exhaust, fumes, aerosol spray, etc. She pulls back from the sexual advances of her husband and spends her nights alone by the TV or wandering around the outside of her well-protected home like an animal in a cage. Her physician examines her and can find nothing wrong. An allergist finds that she has an allergic reaction to milk but explains that there is no treatment for that sort of allergy. She sees a psychiatrist who does nothing but make her nervous. In the hospital, Carol sees an infomercial for Wrenwood, a new-age retreat for those who are ""environmentally ill,"" and leaves her husband and stepson to try and find salvation at this retreat: headed by a phony, grandstanding, ""sensitive"" individual named Peter Dunning."
